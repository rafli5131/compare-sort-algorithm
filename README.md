# Sorting Algorithm Comparison in C++

This project compares the performance of various sorting algorithms implemented in C++. The performance is measured in terms of time complexity for different input sizes.

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented
The following sorting algorithms are implemented:

* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Straight Sort
* Merge Sort
* Rekursif Quick Sort
## Installation
